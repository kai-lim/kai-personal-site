## Hello! 

Hi! I am a senior data scientist working on real-world data at a pharmaceutical company called Novo Nordisk. 

I mainly use this website to document my learning journey as a data scientist. It consists of topics such as causal inference, machine learning, visualisation and coding tips! 


I code in R, SQL and Python mainly. My native language is R.
