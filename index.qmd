## Hello! 

Hi! I am a senior data scientist working on real-world data in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. 

I mainly use this website to document my learning journey as a data scientist. It consists of topics such as causal inference, machine learning, visualisation and coding tips! 


I code in R, SQL and Python mainly. My native language is R.

I moved south of Thames and was based at the Social, Genetics and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) centre to begin my academic journey. The full name of the "MSc GED PP" course was a mouthful -- it stands for "Genes, Environment and Development in Psychology and Psychiatry"!
